# Travel Salesman Problem
**TSP**  - looking for shortest possible route that visits each city and returns to the origin city.

## Algorithms:
* Brutforce 
* Dynamic Programming
* Tabu Search
	- Diversification strategy
	- Aspiration criteria 
* Genetic Algorithm
	- Crossover: PMX
	- Mutation: Insertion/ Swap

## Run program:
To run program run script `*go.sh*`. 
Becouse some of algorithms are based on random choices, you can run n-times and calculate average cost and time.
To use that run script with n-times number as command line arguments:  `*go.sh 20*`.

## Results:
Result can be saved as `*.csv'` file which contains: cost, time, path, all params used
Results will be savd for current best path and average.
